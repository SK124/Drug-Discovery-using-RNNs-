# Fragment-Based-Drug-Discovery-using-RNNs-
A simple approach on generating drug sequences using LSTMs 
In this repo you will find a ipynb notebook which uses the power of LSTM's to generate Drug Sequences 

The idea used in this project is highly infuenced by the paper : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836943/

Please go through the notebook and this project is open for constructive criticism.
