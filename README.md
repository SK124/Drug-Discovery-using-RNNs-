# Fragment-Based-Drug-Discovery-using-RNNs-
A simple approach on generating drug sequences using LSTMs 

In this repo you will find a ipynb notebook which uses the power of LSTM's to generate Drug Sequences 

The idea used in this project is highly infuenced by the paper : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836943/

Please go through the notebook it has explaination and reason behind every code.  

This project is open for constructive criticism. Feel free to drop your opinions and changes you feel would improve its perfomance.
